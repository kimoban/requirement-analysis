# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📘 Introduction

This repository explores **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It outlines the critical role it plays in defining software features and functionalities, ensuring stakeholders have a shared understanding of project scope, expectations, and quality. It also documents examples and diagrams specific to a booking management system.

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the software development lifecycle where teams gather, analyze, and define the requirements of a software product. It ensures clarity between developers, stakeholders, and end users, laying the groundwork for system design, development, and testing.

### 🔑 Key Benefits of Requirement Analysis:
- **Clarity & Understanding**: Eliminates ambiguity by aligning stakeholder expectations.
- **Scope Definition**: Prevents scope creep through well-defined project boundaries.
- **Design & Development Foundation**: Guides system architecture and implementation.
- **Accurate Estimation**: Helps estimate cost, resources, and delivery timelines.
- **Quality Assurance**: Leads to user satisfaction by meeting agreed-upon requirements.

## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity and Understanding**  
   Provides a mutual understanding of the system’s purpose and user needs.

2. **Scope Definition**  
   Clearly outlines project boundaries, preventing scope creep and delays.

3. **Basis for Design and Development**  
   Offers a structured foundation for system architecture and coding decisions.
